## Common bugs when running MacOS on the Dell Inspiron 5447

- Delay on the power button: If you turn off the notebook, when you turn it on again, it generates a delay of 10 to 12 seconds
to connect if using only battery, if the notebook is plugged in this delay does not happens.
* Solution: If you know how to solve this, share it please there, because so far I haven't been able to solve it. :)
------------------------------------
- Bug in the safari browser: when a video is loaded from the web page by Safari on the Notebook, the system will freeze.
* Solution: use another browser and avoid using the Safari browser.
------------------------------------
- Bug in Sleep causes kernel panic: you can close the lid to hibernate and raise the normal functioning, in case
the notebook is charging in the outlet and you can put it to sleep by closing the cover and removing the outlet
and lift the lid there will be a kernel panic and the notebook will restart.
* Solution: avoid lifting the cover if you remove the plug, put or charge the back and lift the cover.
